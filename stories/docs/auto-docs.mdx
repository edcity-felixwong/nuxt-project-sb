I don't think auto docs for vue components are possible right now, without compiler or doc-decoder. For example, when we set a prop like `size=medium`, we implicitly saying `size` could be `small`, `medium` or `large`, this information only exists in the _type_ or in the documentation. This cannot be extracted without some kind of compiler or doc-decoder. To translate the `enum` in TypeScript into JavaScript.
